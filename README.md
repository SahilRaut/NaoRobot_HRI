# NAO Robot


- As the robot is being used as a Dungeon master, this design could be of interest to both children and adults. This could be used in schools for children so they can enjoy playing an interactive game that could have an additional educational aspect to it. The Nao robot has a friendly appearance meaning children will be more accepting of it and we think the game can provoke creativity and a type of thinking unseen in current education environments. It could also be used by adults for entertainment for more complex stories. With the additional implementation of ChatGPT and cards, it could be used for group D&D games or tabletop game events. However, due to the price of the NAO, it may not be affordable for most people restricting its user base
